# Superscalar-processor
instruction set architecture for Superscalar processor RISCV

The pipelined SP processor significantly improves performance by adopting Harvard architecture, hazard resolution mechanisms, and branch prediction. Testing demonstrates functional correctness and notable speedup compared to the non-pipelined design. Future improvements can push CPI closer to 1 and potentially beyond using superscalar and outof-order techniques.
